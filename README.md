# PG-Student-Tools
Very cool, sometimes useful tools for PG student stuff

## Keep List Maker
Takes an mhtml file of a PG course's Grades page (only works on a PG course), and captures all noted items that have grade weight into an easier copy/paste list. I like to put this list in a Google Keep list (because you can add checkbox functionality) so it becomes a "To Do" list for the whole course.

## Discussions Helper
Takes an mhtml file of a PG course's Discussions page (only works on PG course), and captures all relative prompts by the Unit (ignoring extraneous html garbage) into an easy(ier) copy/paste format. I got tired of doing it by hand and wanted something I could more easily use to build my semesterly course Discussions Google docs. I'll be adding onto this script to close that gap more, so eventually this should just build the doc for you.

## Seminar Bot
It's not cheating if you never admit to using it.
